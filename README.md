# Tic-TacToe

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game project! This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Java and JavaFX. The game provides a graphical user interface for users to play against each other.

# Introduction

Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking a cell in a 3x3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

This project is a simple Java application built with JavaFX to provide a visually appealing and interactive user interface for playing Tic Tac Toe.
